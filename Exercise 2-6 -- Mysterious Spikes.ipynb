    "Consider the case when we have only 2-armed bandit and $q_{*}(a)$ are generated from normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set the initial values $Q_{0}(a) = 5$ for each $a$, then for some time (before the estimated lever values $Q$ adjust close to their expected value -- zero) we keep alternating the levers (with very high probability) in the sense, that in step $2k, 2k+1$ we select each of the two levers once. So if there is relatively high probability, let's say $p_{3}$,  of selecting the correct lever in the 3rd step, in the 4th step this probability is almost exactly $1 - p_{3}$. This, along with the fact, that we select the correct lever at step $2*k+1$ with increasing probability (as we gain more information from the previous trials), can explain the spikes.  "
